Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

- Yes, I've heard of, but I have no idea how to use code and to implement it.
 

MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
- Yes, However, I am unable to create it entirely since I do not comprehend the prerequisites of the programming language.

 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 
 -No


Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 1. Codependent
 2. Uniform
 3. Organized
 

Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 - The design can provide outputs in a systematic and methodical manner by dividing the functions over multiple layers.
 - Module isolation makes it possible to identify problems and vulnerabilities in the infrastructure more thoroughly while retaining the particular roles of the other levels unaffected.


Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 - Yes. Due to a lack of knowledge, I had no idea what I was programming, so I just looked up several tutorials on how to accomplish each function, which overlapped with the other tasks I was trying to complete. Ultimately, it turned out to be a combination of many methods I had seen combined.


MVC:
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 
Model, View, Controller
 
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
 Model: It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
 View: Is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
 Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
 

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
 - Yes, the primary problem is that I comprehend the structure sufficiently to be able to make the connections.
 

Web API:
 
 
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 
- Since I'm not experienced with the appearance and functionality of a standard MVC application, I'm not sure what the main differences are. But as far as I can tell, Web APIs employ a blackbox approach, wherein a user requests an output, and the API fulfills the request.

 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

- Installing every dependency for the project was the only issue I ran across. Similar to the WEB API dependencies, I've never troubleshooted them, although I did try lowering the version to make sure it would work.
